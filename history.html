              <h2>EL NIDO</h2>
              <p>
                El Nido has been shown to be inhabited as early as 2680 BC. 
                The island was even mentioned in Chinese records as far back as 1225 where a 
                member of the Chinese Royal Family had called it “Pa Lao Yu” or “Land of Beautiful Harbors”.
                Throughout the Spanish colonization, the town was under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Taytay but became an independent municipality in 1916.
                The first recorded name of El Nido was Talindak but the town was renamed to Bacuit during the Spanish colonization in the 1800s. Later in 1954, the town 
                acquired its name, El Nido which is Spanish for The Nest, because of the numerous edible nests built by tiny swiftlets in the crevices of limestone cliffs.
                El Nido, one of the most diverse ecosystems, is a Managed Resource Protected Area with a total land coverage of 92 thousand hectares, surrounded by 45 islands 
                and has 2,645 hectares of mangrove forest. Its ecosystem contains 447 species of coral, 888 species of fish, 5 species of marine turtles and 114 species of birds.
                In 1984 the Ministry of Natural Resources issued Administrative Order No. 518 established a 360 square kilometer maritime area in El Nido as a turtle sanctuary.
                Then, the rest of Bacuit Bay was proclaimed by the Philippine government as a marine reserve in 1991. The area was expanded a year later by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The status was elevated to a Protected Area which included the terrestrial ecosystem of El Nido and portions of Taytay.
